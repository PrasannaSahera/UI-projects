TO understand Bootstrap, we need to learn 3 thinkgs mainly,
i. Colors & utilities:
    Bootstrap provides 8 colors
        - primary - blue color
        - secondary - gray color
        - success - green color
        - info - skyblue color
        - danger - red color
        - warning - yellow color
        - dark - coalblack color
        - light - white color

    We can use in classnames like btn-primary, bg-success, text-danger etc..,

    utilities :
        Everything in CSS is possible except pseudo classes, transition, animations in bootstrap using classnames

        p - padding ( pt, pb, px, py, ps,pe) - s mean LEFT ; e means END
        m - margin (mt,mb,mx,my,ms,me)
        border -- used for the border
        rounded -- used for border radius
        h - height(w-25,w-50,w-100)
        position - fixed, position-absolute etc.,
        float-left, float-right etc.,
        d-flex, d-none, d-block, d-inline-block etc..,
        gap-0,1,2,3,4,5,justify-content-center, align-items-center

ii. Grid Layout:
    Bootstrap provides a grid of row with 12 columns
    .row --  it is used to assign an element as row and it contains 12 columns
    .col -- it is used to assign an element as col and its width is distributed by row.

    for eg:
        <div class="row">
            <p class="col">Hi</p>
            <p class="col">Hi</p>
            <p class="col">Hi</p>
        </div>

        In above eg: each p will get 4 columns space

        .col-colnumber -- it is used to assign an element as column and it's width is distributed as per its number

        for eg: <div class="row">
            <p class="col">Hi</p>
            <p class="col">Hi</p>
            <p class="col">Hi</p>
        </div>

        In the above eg, row contains two columns width c columns space each and third column wil be in 2nd row as 6 column space (1st row hve 2 cols, next one automatically becomes 2nd row 1st col)

iii. Responsiveness:
        Bootstrap is mainly used for responsiveness and it uses certain breakpoints for the responsiveness.
        Bootstrap follows mobile first design ( design in mobile design first and then do changes for desktop)

        suffixname              width
   ---------------------------------------      -----(no name)          <=5760x (used for mobiles) 
        sm                  >576px to <=768px(landsape mode)    
        md                  >768px to <=992px(tablets)
        lg                  >992px to <=1280px (small laptops, desktop PC)
        xl                  >1280px to 1140px (laptops)
        xxl                 >1400px


Bootstrap is component library means bootstrap provides ready made component which can be used mulitple times whatever we want
