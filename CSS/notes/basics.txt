i. units :
    units are the measurement needded for a specific property

    i. px (pixels) : 
        pixels are the least basic unit of screeen.
    ii. vh/vw( viewport-height/viewport-width): 
        These measurement uses whole screen as 100%
        100vh -- 100% of whole screen height
        100vw -- 100% of whole scree width
    iii. % (percentage) : 
        it is used to measure certain of percent of parent
    iv. em ( enumerated value) : it is x times of parents font-size
        1 em  = 1 * parent font size
    v. rem (root enumerated value) : it is x times of roots font size 
        1 rem = 16px; -- default

use px only few times becuase it is not responsive

ii. box-model : 
    - Any element in HTML is represented  as a box.
    - A box contatins 3 properties.
        i. border : 
            - border is the fence line around the box
            - border: border-width border-style border-color;

            - border-style : sold, dotted, dashed, double
            - border-color: default font-size color
            
            - for every border, we can also assign border-radius( corner-radius)
            - border-radius : size;
            - we can specify border or border-radius to only specific side
            - border-left, border-top, border-right, border-bottom, border-top-left etc.,

        ii. padding : padding means space between border and content of the element ( inside the box)
                padding: left top right bottom
                padding : size;

                padding increases generally height and width. To stop it we can use,
                 box-sizing : border-box;

        iii. margin: margin means space outside the box to the other element.
            margin: size;

By default, every element contains certain margin and padding. we can stop them by using universal selector(*)

iii. fonts and text properties :
        for a good website along with colors, layout, fonts also plays a crucial role. Any fonts in the world belongs to 5 families.
        i. serif : 
            serif fonts will have stroke at the end like times new roman
        eg: times new roman - news papers, blogs, documentation
        ii. san-serif : san serif fonts will not have stroke at the end like Arial. eg: arial
        iii. monospace : monospace fonts have same height to all elements like space mono
        iv. cursive : cursive fonts have stylish letters kind of chained together like cederville
        v. modern / fantasy: fantasy fonts are the modern and different fonts like papyrus eg: disney

    google fonts : will have list of fonts.

    we can include different fonts using 
    a. google fonts : goto google fonts --> select font --> get font --> get embed code --> import --> copy the import link and paste at the top of CSS

text-decoration : line-through - sticking on letter



properties:

font-family: typeface name, family name (eg: times new roman, serif)

font-weight : size(100-1000/bold/bolder) used for thickness

font-style: italic/normal/oblique (more style)
font-size: size in pixels

text-align: center/left/right/end/justify

text-decoration: width style(solid/dotted/dashed/wavy) color position(ubderline/overline/line-through)

text-transform : uppercase/lowercase/captalise

text-shadow : x y z color (eg: 5px 5px 5px green)

letter-spacing: size

line-hegiht : size


iv: colors:
    colors represents brand and css can include colors in multiple ways
    i: colorname : in css, we can directly give name of the color
    ii. hexCode : 0-F => 15chars ; every color will have a hexa decimal code followed by # eg: #5f8082
    iii. rgb(red,gree,blue) : each color takes value from 0 to 255 (8 bit)
    eg : rgba(82,113,21,0.17)

    we can also display lightness to it by aplha (0-1)

    iv. hsl (hue, saturation(dark), lightness) : hue takes degree of the colors, saturation is % of darkness, lightness is % of lightness

    eg: hs1(0,25.00%,79.60%)

    we can also apply alpha to it.
