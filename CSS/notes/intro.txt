CSS (Cacading Style style Sheets):
        - It is a styling language used to control the layout and appearence of web pages. 
        - It is used to separate the styles/design from the structure of web page. 
        - It started in 1994.

CSS syntax contains set of rules known as style, which are applied to elements of the web page. It consists of 

i. selector : it defines what element style will be applied 
ii. property : it defines what property to be applied
iii.value : it defines what value for the given property will be applied.

for eg:

    p -- > selector
    { 
        background-color : red; --> property : value;
    }

CSS Types:

    CSS can be applied to HTML elements in 3 ways

    i. Inline CSS (or) Inline styleing:
            - Defined directly within the HTML element using style as an attribute.

        syntax :
            <element style="property:value....">content</element>

    ii. Internal CSS :
           -  Defined within HTML document using style as an Element.
           -  We can mention style element anywhere but keeping at the end of head will give better performance.

        syntax:

        <style>
            selector
            {
                property:value;
            }
        </style>

    iii. External CSS : 
            - Making all syles in HTML file will make file longer and difficult to understand. so, we can use CSS files separately from HTML using .css extension
            - we can link html to external CSS using link tag. link is a self closing tag.

        syntax:

            <link rel="stylesheet" href="path to css file">

            - content of external file is similar to internal CSS content

                selector
                {
                    property : value;
                }

Out of all three types Inline is more powerful.
!important > Inline > Internal = external


Selectors:

    We can select HTML elements in multiple ways

    i. tag selector :
           - We can select all elements containing specific tag using tag name as a selector

        syntax:

            tagname
            {
                property:value;
            }
    ii. class : 
            - We can select multiple specific elements containing a class name using class selector. 
            - Class selector using dot(.) notation.

        syntax:
            .classname
            {
                property : value;
            }
    iii. Id :
            - we can select any one individual element using Id.
            - we can represent Id using hash(#) notation.

            #Id
            {
                property : value;
            }
            #Id > .class > tag selector
