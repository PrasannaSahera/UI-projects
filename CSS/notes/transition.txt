Transition:
    Transition are used to show the transformation of an element from one state to another state.
    eg: an element increases its height or an element which changes its position.
        transition: transition-property transition-duration transition-timing-function

        transition-property: we can write properties which we need to observe transforming its state or we can mention "all"

        transition-duration: we can mention time in s or ms
        transition-timing-function: we can mention timing functions like
            ease :  grows with gradual speed
            ease-in: initially slow but later fast
            ease-out : initially fase but later slow
            ease-in-out : slow, fast, slow
            lineas : maintains constant speed

        we can use multiple properties for better transitions such as transform, filter, opacity etc.,
        Transform properties contains multiple elements like
        scale : used for zooming and scale(1) is 100%
        translate: used for moving the element and transalateX(200px)
        moves the element 200px on X axis
        rotate(deg) : used for rotating an element
        skew() : used for dragging element with corners

        There are so many filters like grayscalre, saturate, blur, opacity, hue-rotate etc.,
