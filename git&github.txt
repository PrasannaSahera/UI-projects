GIT(software) & GITHUB(website):

    Git is a distributed version control system. It is a software, we need to download and install. Git is used to track changes(versions) in your code base.

    Git is developed and maintained by ORACLE.


    GITHUB is a web based platform that provides a central location to git repositories. It makes others to collaborate into your projects.

    GITHUB is developed and maintained by microsoft.
    eg: github, gitlab, bitbuckets etc., are website which you will share your code into each other and collaboraet.

    bitbuckets is done by amazon.


    Git is free and open source.


    Steps to install GIT:

    1. goto to https://git-scm.com/downloads
    2. operating system -> 64 but windows setup

2. commit :
    It is like saving the changes, it creates a snapshot of particular changes made at that point.
3. branch :
    Branch is separate line in repository, allowing multiple versions of single code, exist.

Git commands:

1. git init:    it will initiate the git
2.git config:   it will let the git know who you are like, name,email,folder...

    git config user.name "your username of github"
This need to done only first time

3. git add . : It will stage all the changes (taking all the changes is staging)
4. git commit -m "message" : it will save your code with some message

5. git remote add origin : it is used to add a repository of github into your git

>> git remote add origin <gitfolderlink> 

I used for my folder > git remote add origin https://github.com/PrasannaSahera/UI-projects.git

6. git push -u origin branch: it is used to push the code into github for first time, it will ask you to login
here "branch" can be main or master it will appear in the editor taskbar check it

for my commits : branch name is master. so command will be,
> git push -u origin master

every change you need to repeat step 3,4,6

git checkout : it is used to change branch name
    egL git checkout branchname
git branch : displays all branches
git status : it will list the changes what happen...
git log: to see all the logs
