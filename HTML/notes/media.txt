Media files are used to represent visual presentation such as images, videos , audios etc.,
we can include different media elements,
    1. audio : we can include audio files in websites using 'audio' tag. 
                The source of audio file will be mentioned with 'source' tag
                After including the audio add the controls (play, pause, download options) attribute to audio tag, otherwise it will not appear
                source is self closing tag

            syntax: 
                <audio autocontrols>
                    <source src="Path to audio file"> <!-- ./ - for current folder, ../- for previous folder -->
                </audio>
    2. video : we can include video files in websites using 'video' tag.
                The source of video file will be mentioned with 'source' tag
                source is self closing tag
                After including the video add the controls  (play, pause, download options) attribute to video tag, otherwise it will not appear
                By default, chrome browser not allow to play the video until we mention autoplay mute attributes.

                <video autocontrols>
                    <source src="Path to audio file">
                </video>

                autocontrols is mandatory to bring controls and we can autoplay and muted also. We can control height and width properties also.
    3. iframe : If we want to mention the external videos, PDF, maps etc., suse this tag
                source attribute will have the location of the file to load, it can be a local or external files
                frameborder will give the border to it, if we dont want then make it 0
                we can give width and height to it to adjust in its place

        iframe is used to present any media of third oarty. It is used embedded code (generated code by third party).
        Iframe contains src(source file/link path), frameborder(border of the frame).
        Any public resource of internet can be embedded

        eg: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/695GrfOHN6o?si=hCestkJZ_6O36G-z" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    4. figure : If we want to show the picture with its caption then we will use this tag.
                figcaption tag will be used to mention the caption of the image

        figure tag is semantic element which is used to print images along with its caption
       
        eg: <figure>
                <img scr="" alt="">
                <figcaption>caption of image</figcaption>
            </figure>
