Day 7: HTML(Hypertext Markup Language):

    web developement started with GML(generalised markup language), later it developed as SGML(standard generalised markup language) and finally in 1992, web starts HTML(hypertext markup language). 
    HTML is used to provide structure/skeleton of the website. It provides all the text,media,forms,button etc.., The current version of HTML is HTML5.
To work with HTML, we need a code editor. Download and install VSCode
  step 1:goto https://code.visualstudio.com/download
  step 2: download 'windows' setup and .exe file will be download
  step 3: double click on downloaded file and next--->next until install -->finish

Day 7:

1. Everything in HTML is developed by tags. We can have open tag and close tag
    <tagname> --- Open tagname
    </tagname> --- Close tagname
2. Whole HTML will be inside <html> and </html>
3. HTML contains '2' elements
    1. Head
    2. Body
4. head contains meta data ( data about data)
5. head also contain title
6. title contains name of the page
5. body contains actual content of the website.

<html>
    <title> My First website </title>
    <body> Hello World </body>
</html>

VScode provides some shortcuts called "emmets"
!+enter or html:5+enter will give basic template of HTML

In HTML, we can mention comments between <!--   and -->. comments are used for better readability of code
